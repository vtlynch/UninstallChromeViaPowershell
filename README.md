# UninstallChromeViaPowershell
This is a standalone setup.exe file from Chrome that can be used to run a powershell command to uninstall the program.

This is used to resolve the error "This Computer Already Has A More Recent Version of Google Chrome. If the software is not working, please uninstall Google Chrome and try again" returned by the Chrome installer even if Chrome has already been uninstalled from the computer.

In some cases you may have already deleted all files related to Chrome. This repository contains setup.exe from the \Chrome\Application\[versionNumber]\Installer\ folder which is needed to execute the Powershell command needed to fix this bug.
